# EVM Bridge Backend

A robust backend service that listens for real-time events emitted by a custom EVM-compatible bridge smart contract and responds by executing relevant bridge logic on-chain.

## ðŸ”— Overview

This backend is designed to support a cross-chain bridge infrastructure using a custom Solidity smart contract. It continuously monitors specific events from the deployed contract and interacts with the blockchain to perform necessary bridging operations automatically.

## ðŸ›  Features

- âœ… Real-time event monitoring using WebSocket connection to the EVM node.
- âœ… Handles cross-chain message passing via a custom bridge contract.
- âœ… Automatically triggers on-chain bridge functions based on emitted events.
- âœ… Configurable environment for multiple EVM-compatible networks.
- âœ… Scalable and modular architecture ready for production use.
